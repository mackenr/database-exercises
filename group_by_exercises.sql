-- Exercises

-- Exercise Goals

-- Use the GROUP BY clause to create more complex queries
-- Create a new file named group_by_exercises.sql
-- In your script, use DISTINCT to find the unique titles in the titles table. How many unique titles have there ever been? Answer that in a comment in your SQL file.
SHOW DATABASES;
USE employees;
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT DISTINCT * FROM titles;

-- Write a query to to find a list of all unique last names of all employees that start and end with 'E' using GROUP BY.

-- Write a query to to find all unique combinations of first and last names of all employees whose last names start and end with 'E'.

-- Write a query to find the unique last names with a 'q' but not 'qu'. Include those names in a comment in your sql code.

-- Add a COUNT() to your results (the query above) to find the number of employees with the same last name.

-- Find all all employees with first names 'Irena', 'Vidya', or 'Maya'. Use COUNT(*) and GROUP BY to find the number of employees for each gender with those names.

-- Using your query that generates a username for all of the employees, generate a count employees for each unique username. Are there any duplicate usernames? BONUS: How many duplicate usernames are there?

-- Bonus: More practice with aggregate functions:

-- Determine the historic average salary for each employee. When you hear, read, or think "for each" with regard to SQL, you'll probably be grouping by that exact column.
-- Using the dept_emp table, count how many current employees work in each department. The query result should show 9 rows, one for each department and the employee count.
-- Determine how many different salaries each employee has had. This includes both historic and current.
-- Find the maximum salary for each employee.
-- Find the minimum salary for each employee.
-- Find the standard deviation of salaries for each employee.
-- Now find the max salary for each employee where that max salary is greater than $150,000.
-- Find the average salary for each employee where that average salary is between $80k and $90k.
